# :parrot: for your terminal

![demo](http://dropit.velvetcache.org.s3.amazonaws.com/jmhobbs/NzczFOYq4g/termbox-parrot-color.gif)  
Runs through wine on mac. `parrot` is aliased to `wine ~/Downloads/RGBPARROT.exe 2> /dev/null`

## Installing

Download the executable from [this repo](https://github.com/AmiyazGitHubLab/RGBParrot/blob/main/RGBParrot.exe). Only windows executable available rn because I cant figure out how to use the go compiler on linux.
  
### Quitting

Hit the escape key to quit.

### -loops

You can limit your parrots enthusiasm with the `-loops` flag.

### :fastparrot:

Set the frame delay with the `-delay` flag (defaults to 75, use 25 for :fastparrot:)

### :aussieparrot:

Use `-orientation aussie` for our friends down under.

## Source code
Its still ugly AF so I need to clean it up a little before publishing it here.  
**Btw you can be 100% sure it is not stolen from another repo because that is scummy behaviour and I am 1000% not scum.**
